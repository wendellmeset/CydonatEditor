# CydonatEditor
An external Replay Mod editor with much more features than the original one, simply open up your Replay mod saved files and have fun!!!!

The ability to have the power of a normal video editor in replay mod has always been wanted, I think. So I have decided to make an external video editor specifically designed for replay mod, with all the features of their current in-game video editor plus more! Music, tinting, overlays, images, everything you would see in a common video editor, all integrated with the ability to interact with replay mod saved data! Do all your editing in one place!

I started this project very recentely, the original name was going to be CrystalCloud Editor but ey who cares! It is programmed in C# via Visual Studio! For now no source or executables are published!

Alpha build coming soon, feel free to put any and all suggestions in issues tab and I will hopefully add them before the project comes out! UI Screenshots Soon! :D

:) :D :) :D
